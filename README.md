# LAI (Laravel, AngularJS & Ionic) Project Starter, Laravel Part.

The Laravel part consists of a fresh install of Laravel 5.2, 'API' optimized, implementing the out of the box Laravel Authentication.
An extra API layer (packages, routes & controllers) has been added so that it can be used as a back-end starter project for an AngularJS or Ionic App.

Including:
* JSON Web Token Authentication (https://github.com/tymondesigns/jwt-auth)
* CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) headers support (https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-cors)
* Fractal for outputing complex, flexible, AJAX/RESTful data structures (https://github.com/thephpleague/fractal)
